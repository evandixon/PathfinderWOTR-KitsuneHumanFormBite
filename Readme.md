# Kitsune Human Form Bite

This is a mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous that lets the kitsune race use their bite attack even while polymorphed as a human.

The kitsune's 'human form in this game is mostly cosmetic and, besides the Master Shapeshifter mythic ability, comes with only downsides.

In the TTRPG version, you're supposed to be able to use the Dragon Disciple's Bite attack even in human form, but due to the implementation in Wrath of the Righteous, the kitsune's human form removes that too.

## Building

Edit KitsuneHumanFormBite.csproj to set WrathPath to your local installation. There's probably a better way of doing this.
